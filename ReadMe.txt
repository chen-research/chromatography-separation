Train_FNN_GsPowerOpt.py 
is the code for performing any one of Experiments 1-8 (transport-dispersive model with Langmuir isotherm) in the paper. The simulated data, which is generated in another code file and should be imported to Train_FNN_GsPowerOpt.py, determines the index of experiment to be performed.

predefined_functions.py 
defines the classes and functions to be called by Train_FNN_GsPowerOpt.py.

Files in dataGenerate
are the codes for generating the dataset (x, r), used to train the Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) in Experiments 1â€“8. The code simulates outlet concentrations of a column by solving a partial differential equation (PDE) using the finite volume approximation method, based on a large set of randomly generated x-samples. These concentrations are then used to construct the response curve r.

Files in generate_response
are the code for performing Experiments 1-8 in the paper. The code is used for generating and plotting chromatographic outlet response with known parameters.
